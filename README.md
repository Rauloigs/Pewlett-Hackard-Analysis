## Overview of the analysis: 
After working with Bobby to provide Data to his boss and the Sales and Development Departments about employees about to retire his manager wants us to determine:

- Number of retiring employees per title. 
- Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

The objetctive of revealing this information is to help Bobby’s manager to prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results:

- From these employees above there are 72,459 about to retire. 
- Senior Engineer and Senior Staff are the title with the highest number of soon retirements. Even by more than 50% than other titles.  


**From the Mentorship Program**

- There are *1941* employees eligible for the mentorship program. 




## Summary: 
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 
72,459 employees. 
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are, due that there are many employees about to retire. It might be needed to go over the data again and evaluate how many titles are there per department, because most of the eligible employees are as well Senior Engineer of Senior Staff.
